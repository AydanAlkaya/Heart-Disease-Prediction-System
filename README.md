# Heart  Disease Prediction System

###### DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROJECT

While Python and Flask are used on the server-side, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are utilized for the web interface. The chosen machine learning algorithm is Logistic Regression. Python and relevant libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy) are employed for data cleaning, data visualization, and data analysis processes. SQLite database is preferred for storing the data.

###### PROJECT'S WEB INTERFACE

The project's web interface consists of a user-friendly form where users can obtain predictions for heart disease. This form allows users to enter the necessary information to receive prediction results.
